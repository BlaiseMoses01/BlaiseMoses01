# 👋 Blaise Moses

I’m a **Software Engineer** focused on building **reliable, scalable AI-driven infrastructure**. I currently work at a **Fortune 500 finacial institution**, where I design tooling that sits at the intersection of **AI systems, data validation, and test infrastructure**.

While my background includes test automation at scale, my long-term focus is firmly rooted in **backend engineering and and applied AI** — especially building tooling that makes complex systems observable, verifiable, and safe.

I’m especially interested in:
- **AI Infrastructure & Evaluation**
- **Developer Tooling & Automation**
- **High-leverage engineering problems**
