# 👋 Hey, I’m Blaise

I'm a **Software Engineer** passionate about building robust, high-performance systems. I currently work at a Fortune 200 company, where I lead test infrastructure development,  but my long-term vision is grounded in systems programming, backend architecture, and the mathematics of software.

I'm particularly interested in **systems-level programming**, **quantitative trading**, and **distributed computing**.

## 💭 Core Philosophy

> Anything in life worth doing is worth doing all the way. So many people do all the work to get to the first plateau and settle, and spend the rest of their life dreaming of the view at the peak. I will see the top of this mountain.
