# 👋 Hey, I’m Blaise Moses

I’m a Software Engineer and SDET who turns QA teams into engineering powerhouses. My code breaks less, scales better, and doesn’t flinch at flaky test cases or brittle pipelines.

Currently:
- 🏦 QA Automation Engineer at Ally (via Brooksource), building robust UI/API test suites with **Playwright**, **Gherkin**, and **TypeScript**
- 🤖 Freelance LLM QA/Engineer, improving AI training pipelines with real-world coding evaluations and benchmarking tools
- 🚀 Building **[30DayQA](https://yourlinkhere.com)** — a no-fluff challenge-based platform to teach real-world test automation and SDET career skills

> Automation isn’t about clicking buttons.  
> It’s about building **systems that scale**, writing tests that **tell the truth**, and thinking like an engineer — not a script jockey.
