# 👋 Hey, I’m Blaise

I'm a **Software Engineer** passionate about building robust, high-performance systems. I currently work at a Fortune 200 company, where I lead test infrastructure development,  but my long-term vision is grounded in systems programming, backend architecture, and the Artificial Intelligence

I'm particularly interested in **Backend Engineering** and **Machine Learning**
