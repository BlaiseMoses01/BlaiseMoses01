# 👋 Hey, I’m Blaise

I'm a **Software Engineer** passionate about building robust, high-performance systems. I currently work at a Fortune 200 company, where I lead test infrastructure development,  but my long-term vision is grounded in systems programming, backend architecture, and the mathematics of software.

I'm particularly interested in **systems-level programming**, **quantitative trading**, and **distributed computing**.

   - Repo : [PonyUp](https://github.com/BlaiseMoses01/PonyUp)
   - Description : PonyUp is a Texas Hold em' Simulator and evenutually a Solver I am using to reinforce my studies in systems programming, statistics, and mathematics. I am building and refactoring it incrementally as I learn and grow more comfortable with the relevant topics.
   - Langauges/Tools : C++
3. **30DaySDET**(Ongoing)
   - 30DaySDET is an e-learning platform I’m building to help QA professionals break into test automation. After graduating into a tough job market, I landed a QA role and taught myself automation, eventually becoming a lead SDET. This project is my way of giving back — offering challenge-based lessons to teach programming fundamentals and       modern automation practices I wish I had when starting out.

## 💭 Core Philosophy

> Anything in life worth doing is worth doing all the way. So many people do all the work to get to the first plateau and settle, and spend the rest of their life dreaming of the view at the peak. I will see the top of this mountain.
