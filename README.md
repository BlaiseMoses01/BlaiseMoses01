# 👋 Hey, I’m Blaise

I'm a **Software Engineer** passionate about building robust, high-performance systems. I currently work at a Fortune 200 company, where I lead test infrastructure development,  but my long-term vision is grounded in systems programming, backend architecture, and the mathematics of software.

I'm particularly interested in **systems-level programming**, **quantitative trading**, and **distributed computing**.

## 📚 Current Studies

After graduating and starting my career in October, I realized I had slacked on studying outside of work. I'm now locked in on strengthening my fundamentals and growing into a systems-level engineer. Here's my current curriculum:

- **📘 C++ Mastery**  
  - Studying modern C++ (C++17/20), STL, memory management  
  - Working through *C++17 in Detail* by Bartłomiej Filipek  
  - Building systems projects like game logic engines

- **🧠 Systems Programming & OS**  
  - Reading *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces*  
  - Exploring processes, memory, scheduling, and concurrency

- **🌐 Networking Fundamentals**  
  - Studying *TCP/IP for Dummies*  
  - Learning and applying socket-based architecture and other key concepts.

- **🧱 Software Design & Patterns**  
  - Working through *Design Patterns* and *C++ Software Design* (O’Reilly)  
  - Implementing reusable patterns in both C++ and TypeScript
  - Practicing key DSA with Leetcode and other Competitive programming platforms. 

- **☁️ AWS Developer Path**  
  - Learning key AWS services: Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, IAM  
  - Building and automating serverless test infrastructure
  - Studying for Certifaction Exams
 
To see my recent studies and projects, check out my repo [BrainDump](https://github.com/BlaiseMoses01/BrainDump) , an archive of notes, code examples,  and other key info related to my various studies, I maintain a log of my studies and contirbutions in the patch notess of this repo!

1. **Selenium UI Automation Suite**
   - Repo : [Selenium Toy Repo](https://github.com/BlaiseMoses01/Selenium_Appium_Example) :
   - Description : A UI testing automation suite targeting a mock login flow on my SDET playground , [30daySDET.dev]()
   - Languages/Tools : Java, Selenium, Allure Reporting, Github Actions
2. **PonyUp** (Ongoing)
   - Repo : [PonyUp]()
   - Description : PonyUp is a Texas Hold em' Simulator and evenutually a Solver I am using to reinforce my studies in systems programming, statistics, and mathematics. I am building and refactoring it incrementally as I learn and grow more comfortable with the relevant topics.
   - Langauges/Tools : C++
3. **30DaySDET**(Ongoing)
   - 30DaySDET is an e-learning platform I’m building to help QA professionals break into test automation. After graduating into a tough job market, I landed a QA role and taught myself automation, eventually becoming a lead SDET. This project is my way of giving back — offering challenge-based lessons to teach programming fundamentals and       modern automation practices I wish I had when starting out.

## 💭 Core Philosophy

> Anything in life worth doing is worth doing all the way. So many people do all the work to get to the first plateau and settle, and spend the rest of their life dreaming of the view at the peak. I will see the top of this mountain.
